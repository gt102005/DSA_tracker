# DSA Tracker

Welcome to DSA Tracker, a React-based application designed to help developers practice and master 100 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions to crack product-based company interviews. Built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), this tool provides an interactive platform to track progress across various DSA topics.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
